# Personal Training Webpage

## Description

The front end of a personal training service web page. This project is mainly intended to showcase my skills as a User Interface Designer (UID). My intentions were to appropriately style a web page whilst making it easy to navigate and still be fit for purpose.

The intended users of this readme document would be prospective employers or other students of web development/UI looking to gain inspiration of some sort. Emphasis should be placed on the fact that this is purely for educational purposes and I have no aspiration of using this as a commercial site. With that being stated, the pictures used are stock images suitable for non-commercial content. The people in the images are not actually clients of mine. Numbers and addresses aren't real. They were used to give a realistic impression for the aesthetic of the layout.

I hope you enjoy my work and any feedback you may have would be greatly appreciated.

## User Experience

### Website Goals

This would be a business to customer (B2C) website. The appropriate considerations were made into marketing and accessibility to the general public although catering more towards our target demographic which would be the working professionals crowd in their 30s and 40s.
Having an online presence in the personal training world is absolutely paramount in today's industry. Especially for increasing residual income revenue streams through social media, video content and ebooks etc. There are many possibilities but the success of them all relies on a loyal, consistent base of followers. Unlike a lot of businesses where the sales are individual products and short term in nature, this website has to promote a longevity of engagement.

<ol>
<li>To create Brand awareness.</li>
<li>Sell Personal Training sessions</li>
<li>Increase client engagement by encouraging them to use our site for extra information thereby increasing the likelihood of  retention</li>
</ol>

### Client Needs

People normally seek out personal trainers for a pillar of support. It's not always the case that clients don't know what they're doing in the gym. It's that they prefer to have someone there that they can trust and build their confidence where they feel they are lagging. The website should feel inviting and at the same time feel rather slick to convey competence that this person is one of the leader's in the industry!

<ol>
<li>To Build Trust</li>
<li>Instil with confidence that the trainer knows their stuff</li>
<li>Be part of a community.</li>
</ol>
 
### Essential Features 

<ul>
<li>Testimonials - Every personal training website has them and there is no better marketing tool than success stories of previous or even current clients.</li>
<li>Incredible images - Often these can be part of the testimonials. Or simply a cool pic from social media to inspire people and let them know what you're upto. </li>
<li>Easy to contact - Purchasing training sessions can be a long thought out process but more often than not it's an emotional buy. People's impulsiveness to go for something highly sought after can lead to snappy decisions which means they need the option to be able to purchase on the spot. No barriers! </li>
<li>Information - With options, can come confusion. Information needs to be in a concise, easy to digest format. with appropriate imagery.</li>
</ul>

### Supplementary Features

<ul>
<li>Payment Online Page- this could be the typical multi-page payment structure similar to what you may find on an e-commerce site. Including a checkout option where you could add/remove packages and chose how you want to pay. Although this would require Javascript which is beyond the scope of this project.</li>
<li>Articles or News letter sign up. Encourages client engagement and longevity. This would require an automated email link option again using Javascript</li>
</ul>

### Page Overview

#### Index page

This is the main hub of the website where the potential clients get to see the trainer's face and who is behind all of this. The home page should be image heavy and information light. 
<ul>
<li>The navigation bar being clear and easy to see every item on show with no small text. Saving that for later pages as the user requests to see them.</li>
<li>It will boast about the latest feature on offer and give the client a direct link to this region.</li>
<li>A grid of large tagline text with images spread in between. The grid should take up the vast majority of the space whilst still containing space around the taglines themselves as to not look too clustered.</li>
<li>External links to relevant social media pages across the bottom in the footer which shouldn't draw away attention from the rest of the main features (no sticky footer or nav bar). </li>
</ul>

#### Results page

Here is the heavy marketing zone of the website. It's located right next to the home page for a reason. It has to scream that Wow factor! Plenty of images but still look slick and in keeping with the rest of the website. 
<ul>
<li> Headline shows bold text notifying users what page they're on. In addition to the actively highlighted nav bar item for futher clues . This is useful especially as some users may be visually impaired.</li>
<li>A similar grid to the home page in style. Only this time more focus on the images. Accompanied by the inline testimonial. Testimonial text should be slightly larger than standard browser text (16px).</li>
<li>An option for more information in the form of a collapsible accordian structure. This allows space to be optimised and not steal away attention from the amazing testimonial pictures.</li>
<li>The first direct call to action, in the form of a motivational image with a tagline overlaid, next to a button. Reinforced by the content above.</li>
</ul>

#### Training page

As the flow of the website progresses and hopefully now people are starting to absorb the wow factor but they might have some questions. Information takes over a little. Clearly laying out the structure along side some useful icons to cater to the right-brained prospects.

<ul>
<li> Similar style headline to results page. Only now there are two to break up the different sections establishing a clear cut off for option A and B.</li>
<li>A block style grid that no longer contains borders as the extra text combined with lots of boxes would feel very claustrophobic. Text here is standard browser default size to allow for more space.</li>
<li>Price menus detailing what you're getting for your money have to look sophisticated as some of the options aren't cheap.</li>
<li>Call out form near bottom encouraging the user to make a decision by offering the consultation for free.</li>
</ul>

#### Contact page

By this point most of the selling aspects of the website have been covered. What's left is to clear up any final queries, comments or concerns the user may have.

<ul>
<li> Similar style headline to results page. Less flashy - no people in the image.</li>
<li>In keeping with the grid theme, it is a similar layout to the previous pages. Only this time a smaller grid detailing an address accompanied by interactive map. </li>
<li>A general query form to address anything the user may have to say or ask.</li>
<li>Final Call out to follow on social media. Increasing client engagement.</li>
</ul>

### Future Features

These could be implemented at a later date but unfortunately the timescale and limited resources combined with the fact that these are not priority goals of the client, means the scope of what these features would require is simply too much at this stage.

<ul>
<li>Exclusive Member's area. Gives potential clients another reason to want to be a client. There would be some blog articles/videos on offer for free in a blog/ article section which would then offer the user to become a member for the premium content. This would be a password protected membership access thereby needing a database to store such information and means to keep it secure such as SSL. </li>
<li>Video content of people training. Gives more of an immersive experience for the user as to what the training will feel like. Potential draw backs could be on the performance of the website depeding on the size and quality of the video.</li>
</ul>

## Testing

Here I test the front end in 3 manners. First of all, probably considered the most fundamental test is whether or not the interactive elements of the website actually work as intended. This will include things like navigation links, buttons, forms being submittable with correct validation. Also to check syntax in the code itself.

Secondly is the compatibility of the program. It's easy to assume it works from the computer that the project was written on but what about other devices? Large screen desktops? Mobile devices?  Furthermore one has to consider the different operating systems and even more so the array of browsers that could host the website. 

The final manner of testing is Usability, does the website cater to individuals with learning disabilities? How easy is it to navigate from one section to another? Does the website look good? How consistent is the structure across the pages? 

### Functionality

Link Test:
There are 3 types of links that were used in my project. Namely external  (leave the website), internal (direct to another page of the website) or anchor (directs to a specific region of a page). The default anchor '#' is the top of the same page.

To ensure all the links were working, I had to count the number of opening 'a' and 'button' tags on each page. An easy way of doing this is to use ctrl+f and search tool in my IDE (for this project I used Visual Studio Code) and it would return result 1 out of the total count. Or it could return a 'No Results' message but this would be a problem on a website with multiple html pages.

#### Link Count

index page contains
ext 5, internal 5, anchor 2 (essentially same link but active in 2 different resolutions) - Total 12
results page contains
ext 5, int 5, anchor 1 (button link) - Total 11.
training page contains
ext 5, int 5 , anchor 5 - Total 15 (Note - 5 price button links were set as anchor tags due to there being no destination page)
contact page contains
ext 7, int 5  anchor 0. (Note- 1 ext link is on the googlemaps iframe) - Total 12.                 

 Knowing where all the anchor tags and buttons are located, I would then systematically hover the cursor over every link and button on each page and note the outcome. I used the following check list to ensure each link was working correctly.

#### Link/Button Checklist

<ol>
<li>Upon hovering the cursor over the link. The expected hover effect (as written in the stylesheet) takes place.</li>
<li>The cursor changes from an arrow pointer icon to a hand icon.</li>
<li>Upon clicking the link or button any active effect put in place should be now shown.</li>
<li>The destination page or region is located correctly.</li>
<li>Destination page is located in the appropriate tab.</li>
</ol>

#### Expected Outcome

<ol>
<li>I had set my link elements to subtly change colour to a brighter instance of the colour already in place. All links typically went from grey color #c6c0c0 to bright white #fff upon hovering. Buttons had no hover effect.</li>
<li>The cursor should indeed change from an arrow pointer icon to a pointing hand icon on all links and buttons.</li>
<li>I didn't add any active effects.</li>
<li>Should reach the location listed in the 'href' property of the anchor tag or the 'action' property of the form button.</li>
<li>External links should be opened in a new tab. Internal in the same tab.</li>
</ol>

#### Result

All 50 links passed.

Form Test:
There are only 2 forms on my site. They are both formatted under the same CSS rules in my stylesheet. So the consistency is 100% across all forms. Because this is a front end project only the button can't actually do as intended and submit forms as that would require a backend using JavaScript to use some business logic to store it into a database or potentially create email links. 

At the moment, the only current features that should be able to pass tests are the validation of the submitted entries and the default entries being populated.

For validation testing all possible permutations of entry boxes containing at least one character or more must be considered. In this case, one of the forms has 4 entry fields (training page) and the other 3 (contact page). The validation at the front end scope will only determine whether the fields are empty or not. It will not be able to assess whether the format of the entry matches a certain regex pattern for example emails containing no spaces and at least one '@' and '.' character. Further backend code is required in order for this type of testing to be carried out.

The form button typically executes some action upon being clicked but as there is no back end the button will simply serve as an anchor link to the top of the page if all required entries are non-empty. I will call this scenario Successful validation or SV in short. Contrary to this Unsuccessful Validation (UV) will be where at least one field is found to be empty that should be non-empty. In this case, a pop up will appear notifying the user that from the top down the first empty required field it comes across must be non empty. 
 
The contact page form is the simplest test so let's start with that one. All fields are required here therefore Succesful Validation should happen in one scenario only - Three non-empty entry boxes. In order to complete the test play out the following scenarios after each one hit the 'Send' button:

    Key: FullName=FN, Email=E, Query=Q, non-empty= ne, empty=e.<br>

    FN:e,E:e,Q:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:e,Q:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:ne,Q:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:ne,Q:ne -> SV<br>

#### Contact Form Result

Passed.

Training page form has two SV cases with the availability field either empty or non-empty whilst all other required fields are non-empty.

    FN:e,E:e,A:e,G:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:e,A:e,G:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:ne,A:e,G:e -> UV<br>
    FN:ne,E:ne,A:e,G:ne -> SV<br>
    FN:ne,E:ne,A:ne,G:ne -> SV<br>

#### Training Form Result

Passed.

#### W3C Validation

To complete the functionality testing, I ran my code through the W3C validation service for both HTML and CSS (linked below).

HTML: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
CSS : https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

index page:
1 error. I had used the "image" tag instead of "img". This was easily fixed.

results page:
On the first check i received only small errors regarding duplicate ids. I resolved the issue by adding slightly more specific information onto each of the id's names following up to ensure that these new names were copied across to the appropriate CSS selector rules. The duplicated id in question was "result2" which was then changed into "result-sm2" and "result-md2" for the different resolutions to which they applied. 

There was a section with no header. To fix this i simply merged this section with the section above which contained the header by removing the necessary closing and opening "section" tags and replacing the opening "section" tag of the section in question with a div containing the same classes.

training page:
Another duplicate id was the #online. I checked to see which CSS rules applied to this id and surprisingly enough there were none so I simply deleted the id altogether. 

contact page:
An issue was flagged with regards to the iframe for the google map I embedded. Stating the frame border was obsolete due to the styling i had applied to it. I deleted the frame-border property and the warning went away.

style.css page:
There was only one error and that concerned the transform-origin property being applied to the toggler-icon for the accordian. I had written "transform-property: 50 0;" with no units. The intent of my animation was to go from a collapsed state ('+') to an expanded state ('-'). Somehow despite putting no units I managed to make my animation look the same as the desired collapsed state. I realised what I needed to do was set this to "50% 50%" to account for the 90 degree rotation of the vertical bar otherwise it would look like a 'T' on its side.
There were a lot of warnings stating "unknown vendor extension". However these related to the validators inability to recognise special properties that controlled how the animation would work on different browsers. 

    -webkit-transition: color 0.5s;
    -moz-transition: color 0.5s;
    -o-transition: color 0.5s;

These prefixes are essential to allow my site to be compatible so in this case i had to ignore the warnings.


#### Color Contrast Accessibility Validator

To ensure I had the appropriate contrasts set between foreground text and background color, I wanted an objective test hence feedback was sought from this site, recommended by W3C consortium.
https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/

Typically a pass requires that no direct color combinations (meaning background to foreground comparison) are under 3 when it comes to the contrast. I ended up picking a very simplified colour scheme of predominantly black and white making this quite easy to achieve. 

The website passed.

### Compatibility

I only have access to two different OS - linux and mac. I wasn't prepared to boot my computer in another one, simply to see if the website looked good on it. However i did manually check the site on 4 different browsers. Those which are considered to be the most popular are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. 

As well as the browser i had to cross check that against the different resolutions starting with mobile building moving through upto full size desktop.

#### Criteria for assessment

<ul>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Colour</li>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Functionality - toggle icons, links, buttons</li>
</ul>

For each criterion i was comparing the site for which I had deployed on google chrome against how it appeared on the test browser in question. As i landed on each page I would check the mobile, tablet and desktop options to see how they faired. Also that nothing varied unexpectedly especially that could hamper the User Experience in anyway.

#### Results

Nothing noteworthy changed certainly to any level that I was aware of. Except for the heading in 'Monserrat' font did look less heavy as if the display-4 class for the large text hadn't quite fully translated across to this browser. As it wasn't a pressing issue and the overall aesthetic still looked good. I allowed it to remain unchanged. 


## Code to Website

This project can easily be deployed on your local system by following these simple steps...

<ol>
<li>Open your terminal and create a folder (command: 'mkdir [folder_name]') in the location where you want to bring the Github repository.</li>
<li>Copy this url: https://github.com/Domchap90/personal-training.git </li>
<li>Go back to your terminal and move INSIDE your new folder (command:'cd [folder_name]'). </li>
<li>Type 'git clone ' then paste in the url and press Enter.</li>
<li>The git repository is now in your local file system and ready to be deployed on your IDE.</li>  
</ol>

If you don't already have an IDE set up. I would recommend using an online alternative like gitpod instead.
gitpod.io/docs/getting-started/

Or why not run it on replit? <br>
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Domchap90/personal-training)](https://repl.it/github/Domchap90/personal-training)<br>
After clicking on the link, simply set the language to the 'HTML,CSS and JS' option.<br><br> 
Then the run code to:

    run = "echo launch.json"

Then feel free to explore.


## Technologies

Below are the technologies that i worked with for this project and in many cases they were vital to keeping my code more concise.
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code was the main IDE I was using. I did think about using gitpod however there are a lot of times whilst im working that I don't have access to the internet. 
</li>
<li>
Bootstrap version 4 - Became very useful with respect to making my site responsive and taking some work load from the stylesheet.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/
</li>
<li>
For the icons used in the nav bar, footer and on the training page.
"https://kit.fontawesome.com/d19a086ec7.js
</li>
<li>
Jquery plugin for some of the bootstrap features such as the collapsible navbar and accordian. 
https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js
</li>
<li>
Popper plugin also for collapsible navbar.
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js
</li>
<li>
Google font API for the two prominent fonts used; Monserrat and Lora.
https://fonts.google.com/
</li>
</ul>

## Resources

The logo was created using a company called Free Logo Design:

<a href="https://www.freelogodesign.org/">https://www.freelogodesign.org/</a>

I used Jesse Couch's pen for the hamburger icon animation:
<a href="https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/Atyop">https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/Atyop</a>

From this pen i was able to figure out how to do a similar type of animation. This time used for the toggle icon
on the expandable accordian feature for the FAQs.

I am a big fan of rgb to hexadecimal converters online. 
<a href="https://www.rgbtohex.net/">https://www.rgbtohex.net</a>

This was used when I originally used hexadecimal coloring for the shaded overlays ontop of the wide fluid containers labelled as 'headline's. I tried to make the overlays reveal the image underneath by initially changing the 'opacity' property. However the downside to this is that it also alters the text opacity which made it very difficult to read. As a result I chose to use the 'rgba' for the 'background' property instead yielding much better results.
    .headline-overlay { background: rgba(36,34,45,0.5); }

Another website that became of great utility when I had to check the visual aspects over was the contrast checker.<br> 
<a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>

This was used in conjunction with the Google chrome developer tools extension which helped me endlessly with regards to troubleshooting my code. To the extent where I'm not sure how I would cope without it! Developer tools is tremendously useful in peeling back the layers of styling code that are applied to different resolutions.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentor Brian for helping me out with some much needed advice especially when it came to the general look and design of the website. I'm not naturally the most creative person and i often find it hard to gauge what looks good on my own.
