                Your Journey Begins with a movement screen, despite sounding a little scary this is simply a way for
                me to collect the fundamental information on how your body naturally moves, its current limitations 
                and capabilities. <br><br> For example it's necessary to know what ranges of motion you have at your 
                hips, knees and ankles in order for you to execute a squat efficiently.<br>

                Communication is key with the online training more so than with 1-2-1 because I am never in the gym with
                you. Accurate record keeping is essential with regards to training logs, food diaries and weigh ins which
                will be more frequent compared with the online program. <br><br>
                With technology being what it is today, I would recommend using your phone for all of these tasks. Especially
                recording your weights/reps in the gym. Use our handy <span>mobile app</span> to keep all your records in one place!

                However it's not simply a case of finding the right program alone. It takes discipline and the correct mental
                attitude to tackle a training plan. I will help you with this in the 'Hands On' package.

                Guidlines will be sent across to you about how to perform and video yourself performing a movement screen.<br><br>
                See 1-2-1 section for details of why you must perform a screen before starting a program.

                Communication is key with the online training more so than with 1-2-1 because I am never in the gym with
                you. Accurate record keeping is essential with regards to training logs, food diaries and weigh ins which
                will be more frequent compared with the online program. <br><br>
                With technology being what it is today, I would recommend using your phone for all of these tasks. Especially
                recording your weights/reps in the gym. Use our handy <span>mobile app</span> to keep all your records in one place!
