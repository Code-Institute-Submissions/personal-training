                Your Journey Begins with a movement screen, despite sounding a little scary this is simply a way for
                me
                to collect the
                fundamental information on how your body naturally moves, its current limitations and capabilities.
                For
                example it's necessary
                to know what ranges of motion you have at your hips, knees and ankles in order for you to execute a

                In order for you to reach your fullest potential and maximize results, this option is what we
                strongly recommend.
                Especially if you're seeking out to gain confidence in the weight's room. I have over 10,000 hours
                of
                face to face client
                experience so when it comes to dealing with getting the most out of an exercise I can set you up
                with
                the correct
                structure and feel to reap the full benefits of your program.<br>

                Your Journey Begins with a movement screen, despite sounding a little scary this is simply a way for
                me
                to collect the
                fundamental information on how your body naturally moves, its current limitations and capabilities.
                For
                example it's necessary
                to know what ranges of motion you have at your hips, knees and ankles in order for you to execute a
                squat efficiently.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="training-grid-item program text d-none d-lg-block">
                All of the data from the movement screen is used to prepare your program for the coming months.
                <br>The first few sessions can be fairly tough and I will push you as much as necessary depending on
                your current level and also what your goal demands.<br>
                My Philosophy is Consistency & Frequency before Intensity. Meaning get
                plenty of practice with the key exercises before starting to build up the weights.
